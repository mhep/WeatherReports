        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
         <b>How is wind perceived? In this AHRC & DFG funded, interdisciplinary research project, we investigate the nature of wind as model, media, and experience, triangulating embodied experience, data practices, and aesthetic production. Our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of what changes with climate change through the medium of wind, drawing on research from
          across the Environmental Humanities and Media Studies.</b> 
        </p>

        <p>
          Wind focalises the larger epistemological and ontological problems we
          face in light of climate change. Like climate, wind is not an
          immediate, conspicuous object of perception. Wind surrounds us and is
          experienced continuously in varying degrees of intensity, without ever
          appearing directly ‘before our eyes’. Like climate, wind’s ephemeral
          nature–second only to barometric pressure–motivates a turn to
          instruments, measurement, calculation, abstraction, and modelling in
          order to arrive at an objective, scientific perspective on wind. Like
          climate, wind draws together different spatial and temporal scales.
          Local winds tie into global atmospheric circulation, becoming both an
          effect and agent of climate change, given their role in
          desertification, in changing circulation patterns, and intensifying
          storms.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to make sense of wind as something both experienced
          <em>and</em> measured, local <em>and</em> global, we explore the
          elemental nature of wind through three different perspectives: wind as
          model, media, and experience. We here follow Media Studies’ recent
          turn toward the elemental.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instructed by the phenomenon of wind, this project opens up new
          perspectives for refiguring the relationship between model, media, and
          experience in light of climatic changes across temporal and spatial
          scales. We then hope to contribute to a better understanding of
          experiences of climate change through the medium of wind.
